  <h2>Person Card Mockup</h2>
  <p>My parter for this project is Mandy - below are my mockups for her person card.</p>
  <p>Mandy gave me a choice between the two elephant related ideas. I decided to go with #2, Stampede. I'd like to work on CSS animations and this seemed like a straightforward way to tackle basic movements.</p>

  <h2>Post 1</h2>
  <p>I'm interested in figuring out my ideal project structure for static sites, so this journal is going to be incredibly basic for now.</p>
  <p>My requirements are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintainable and easily searchable project structure</li>
    <li>As modular as a static site can be</li>
    <li>Uses task runners and SASS compilers in my dev environment</li>
    <li>Is able to showcase a variety of different projects</li>
  </ul>
